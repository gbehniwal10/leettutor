# Deep Research Prompt: ADHD Visual Attention & Eye Movement Differences — Implications for UI Design

Conduct a comprehensive literature review at the intersection of ADHD visual attention research and user interface design. Address the following areas:

## 1. Eye Movement & Gaze Differences in ADHD

- What does the eye-tracking literature show about differences between ADHD and neurotypical controls in: fixation duration, saccade patterns, microsaccades, smooth pursuit tracking, and gaze stability?
- Are there reliable differences in ability to maintain sustained fixation on a single target (e.g., reading a paragraph, watching a progress indicator)?
- What about involuntary attentional capture — are ADHD individuals more susceptible to peripheral visual stimuli pulling gaze away from a focal task?

## 2. Visual Noise Sensitivity & Distractor Interference

- Is there evidence that ADHD populations are differentially affected by visual clutter, background motion, competing visual elements, or high information density on screen?
- What does the flanker task / visual search / change blindness literature say about ADHD differences in filtering irrelevant visual information?
- Are there threshold effects — i.e., is there a point at which visual complexity overwhelms ADHD attentional control while leaving neurotypical controls unaffected?

## 3. Inhibition of Return & Attentional Disengagement

- How does ADHD affect the ability to disengage attention from one visual element and shift to another (relevant to navigating multi-panel UIs)?
- Is there evidence of differences in inhibition of return (the normal suppression of recently attended locations)?

## 4. UI/UX Design Implications

- Has any research directly studied UI design variables (color contrast, animation, layout density, whitespace, font size, element spacing) and their differential impact on ADHD users' task performance, comprehension, or error rates?
- What can we infer from the basic science (sections 1-3) about optimal visual design for ADHD users, even if not directly studied in a UI context?
- Are there published design guidelines or frameworks (academic or industry) specifically addressing visual design for ADHD?

## 5. Actionable Design Principles

- Based on the evidence, what specific, concrete UI design recommendations can be made? Consider: information density per viewport, animation/motion policies, color and contrast strategies, progressive disclosure vs. all-at-once layouts, typography and reading flow, notification/alert visual treatment, and use of whitespace as a cognitive aid.
- Where does the evidence conflict or remain insufficient to make confident recommendations?

## Scope & Methodology Notes

- Prioritize peer-reviewed empirical studies (eye-tracking, psychophysics, HCI) and systematic reviews/meta-analyses over opinion pieces or blog posts.
- Include both child and adult ADHD populations but flag when findings are age-specific.
- Note effect sizes where reported — I care about magnitude, not just statistical significance.
- If relevant research exists on ADHD subtypes (inattentive vs. hyperactive-impulsive vs. combined), note differential findings.
- Cover literature through early 2025 if possible.
