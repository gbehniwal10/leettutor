  "description": "You are given an n x n integer matrix grid where each value grid[i][j] represents the elevation at that point (i, j).\nThe rain starts to fall. At time t, the depth of the water everywhere is t. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most t. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.\nReturn the least time until you can reach the bottom right square (n - 1, n - 1) if you start at the top left square (0, 0).\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n```\nInput: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nAt time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).\nYou cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.\nYou cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.\nWhen the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.\n\n```\n**Example 2:**\n\n```\nInput: grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]\nOutput: 16\nExplanation: The final route is shown.\nWe need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.\n\n```\n**Constraints:**\n\n- `n == grid.length`\n- `n == grid[i].length`\n- `1 <= n <= 50`\n- `0 <= grid[i][j] < n2`\n- `Each value grid[i][j] is unique.`\n",
